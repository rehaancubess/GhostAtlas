# Unit Tests

This directory contains unit tests for Lambda functions and utility modules.

## Structure

Tests are organized to mirror the source code structure:
- `lambdas/` - Tests for Lambda function handlers
- `utils/` - Tests for utility functions
- `constructs/` - Tests for CDK constructs

## Running Tests

```bash
npm test                 # Run all tests
npm run test:watch       # Run tests in watch mode
```

Tests will be implemented alongside their corresponding modules in subsequent tasks.
